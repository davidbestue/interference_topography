# Interference topography

Analysis of the WM task L2 conducted during my master thesis.
Codes for simulations, and raw data are not included. Local paths given for all of them.

<pre>Reduction of interference when removing noise
less noise --> less interference
Potential explanation of what is attention causing here: reduction of noise.</pre>
