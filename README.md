# Interference topography

Analysis of the WM task L2 conducted during my master thesis.
Codes for simulations, and raw data are not included. Local paths given for all of them.

## Psychophysics:

#### create_pdDataframe.ipynb
From raw txt files generates "idibaps_psychophysics.csv"
Path of this files (.ipynb and .csv):
"C:\Users\David\Dropbox\IDIBAPS\my code\Project 1 (master thesis)"


#### dist_a_err_analysis.ipynb
Analysis of Angular interference (distributions)
Analysis of Angular interference (perceptual and memory)
Analysis of Controls (dispersion of angular error with eccentricity)

## Monkey:

#### monkey_analysis.ipynb
<b>
Analysis of Christos Dataset


#### monkey_tuning_curves.ipynb
Relevant results concearning the tunning curves of monkey neural data



<b>
  

## Simulations:

#### memory_interference_simulations.ipynb

Simulations for memory interference effects


#### simulations_broadening_eccentricity.ipynb

Analysis of the modeling of radial dimension
More broad bumps with eccentricity

#### controls_angle_err_eccentricity_simulations.ipynb

Simulations for increase of angle error with eccentricity

#### attention as noise reduction.ipynb

Reduction of interference when removing noise
less noise --> less interference
Potential explanation of what is attention causing here: reduction of noise.
