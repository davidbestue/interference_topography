# Interference topography

Analysis of the WM task L2 conducted during my master thesis.
Codes for simulations, and raw data are not included. Local paths given for all of them.

_Path of this files (.ipynb and .csv):_  
_"C:\Users\David\Dropbox\IDIBAPS\my code\Project 1 (master thesis)"_  
  
  
#### dist_a_err_analysis.ipynb  
_Analysis of Angular interference (distributions)_    
Analysis of Angular interference (perceptual and memory)  
Analysis of Controls (dispersion of angular error with eccentricity)_

## Simulations:

#### memory_interference_simulations.ipynb  

_Simulations for memory interference effects_


#### simulations_broadening_eccentricity.ipynb  

_Analysis of the modeling of radial dimension
More broad bumps with eccentricity_

_Reduction of interference when removing noise
less noise --> less interference
Potential explanation of what is attention causing here: reduction of noise_
