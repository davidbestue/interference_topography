## Interference topography

Analysis of the WM task L2 conducted during my master thesis.
Codes for simulations, and raw data are not included. Local paths given for all of them.

#### Files:

### create_pdDataframe.ipynb
From raw txt files generates "idibaps_psychophysics.csv"
Path of this files (.ipynb and .csv):
"C:\Users\David\Dropbox\IDIBAPS\my code\Project 1 (master thesis)"


### dist_a_err_analysis.ipynb
Analysis of Angular interference (distributions)
Analysis of Angular interference (perceptual and memory)
Analysis of Controls (dispersion of angular error with eccentricity)


### simulations_broadening_eccentricity.ipynb
Analysis of the modeling of radial dimension
More broad bumps with eccentricity


### attention as noise reduction.ipynb
Reduction of interference when removing noise
less noise --> less interference
Potential explanation of what is attention causing here: reduction of noise.


### monkey_analysis.ipynb
Analysis of Christos dataset


### monkey_tuning_curves.ipynb
Relevant results concearning the tunning curves of monkey neural data


### controls_angle_err_eccentricity_simulations
Simulations for increase of angle error with eccentricity
